# YepNope.js

YepNope used to be supported.  It is not supported any longer, as the package 
itself has been depreciated.  If anyone wants to make it work with the new 
version, I'd be happy to post it here.

Documentation at the time of last working is available in the 
<a href="https://github.com/jtsage/jquery-mobile-datebox/commit/37d1b38c7a5caa2504d62c7a58821cbdfc121c2e">GitHub Archive</a>

# Ruby on Rails

There is a gem created by Guidecase available on <a href="https://github.com/Guidecase/jquery_mobile_datebox-rails">GitHub</a>

# require.js 

There is a build of DateBox with AMD bindings.  Take a look at
the <a href="../3rd/backbonerequire/">demo</a>.
